# AdventOfCode2021 :christmas_tree:
Solutions to all 25 AoC 2021 problems in Rust, using less than **100 lines** per day :crab:

All solutions are quite short and efficient while still being readable and idiomatic. The code emits zero clippy warnings and has a total execution time of about `1.2s`.

See [timings.md](./timings.md) for execution time and output of each solution.

Thanks again for another amazing year of AoC, especially the subreddit community and of course [@ericwastl](https://twitter.com/ericwastl)! Overall, I thought 2021 was one of the best years yet. The difficult was just right. Definitely harder than 2020 I thought but not more than 2019.

## Usage
```sh
cargo run --release --bin [DAY] # run a specific day
cargo run --release             # run all days
```

## Leaderboard placings
The puzzles unlock at `06:00` in the morning in my timezone. This is the second year in a row I've set an alarm for `5:50` for 25 days in a row to complete for leaderboard placings (except day 11 when I overslept)!

Went very well this year compared to [last year](https://github.com/AxlLind/AdventOfCode2020/), top 1000 for `18/25` days. Set a new personal best of `153`!
