## Leaderboard placings
The puzzles unlock at `06:00` in the morning in my timezone. This is the second year in a row I've set an alarm for `5:50` for 25 days in a row to complete for leaderboard placings (except day 11 when I overslept)!

Went very well this year compared to [last year](https://github.com/AxlLind/AdventOfCode2020/), top 1000 for `18/25` days. Set a new personal best of `153`!
